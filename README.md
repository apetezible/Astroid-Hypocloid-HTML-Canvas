# Astroid Hypocloid HTML Canvas
Let's draw an Astroid Hypocloid on the HTML Canvas. There is an interesting object on the Analytic Geometry which is a curve made on a specific iteration of straight Segments, you just tell me the number of Segments (Iterations) and I will construct the object.

The way I'm going to do it will be setting up a 300px x 300px Canvas. There is a Method for making straight Segments on the Canvas, therefore an inconvinience will come out because that Method is Complex, I solved that problem by making a function whose parameters are specified in the JavaScript code. For the iteration element of the Figure there is a free choice of lines left for you at the HTML. For making another Figure you have to reload the HTML for a cleaner image.
